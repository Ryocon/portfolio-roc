## Description

For this project I have made a portfolio page using only html and css. The projects currently listed are placeholder projects bar the main project which was added to fufill the criteria of linking to a deployed application.

I have taken a clean approach to the design of the page. The white background (despite being a lover of dark mode) worked for the colour scheme I had chosen. I used css to create effects on the text on the page and make it somewhat interactive.

The links for both in-page and external are fully functional. The page is responsive for different screen sizes using the flexbox property for both larger and smaller 
sizes.

## Technologies
HTML and CSS are used to create this portfolio page.

## Future Updates
In the future I would like to recreate the portfolio page using a CSS framework such as Tailwind as I am now more confident in working with styling.
