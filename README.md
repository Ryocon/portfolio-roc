# portfolio-roc

## Description

For this project I have made a portfolio page using only html and css. The projects currently listed are placeholder projects bar the main project which was added to fufill the criteria of linking to a deployed application.

I have taken a clean approach to the design of the page. The white background (despite being a lover of dark mode) worked for the colour scheme I had chosen. I used css to create effects on the text on the page and make it somewhat interactive.

The links for both in-page and external are fully functional. The page is responsive for different screen sizes using the flexbox property for both larger and smaller sizes.
