## Description

For this project I have made a portfolio page using only html and css. The projects listed are fully deployed with a clickable link to said deployed page. The only project currently unavailable is the 'react portfolio'. This was left there intentionally as an aspirational target for myself.

I have taken a clean approach to the design of the page. The white background (despite being a lover of dark mode) worked for the colour scheme I had chosen. I used css to create effects on the text on the page and make it somewhat interactive.

The links for both in-page and external are fully functional and now include links to a digital animated CV and a downloaded PDF version. The page is responsive for different screen sizes using the flexbox property for both larger and smaller 
sizes.

## Technologies
HTML and CSS are used to create this portfolio page.

## Future Updates
In the future I would like to recreate the portfolio page using a CSS framework such as Tailwind as I am now more confident in working with styling.
